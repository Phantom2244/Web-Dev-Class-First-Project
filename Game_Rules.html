        <p>HOW THEMES AND TAGS INTERACT</p>
        <p>Every player character in City of Mist (CoM) is made of 4 "Theme Cards," each having 3 power tags, 1 weakness tag, and either a mystery or identity based on whether the theme is Mythos ("supernatural") or Logos ("mundane").</p>
        <p>Whenether a player takes an action, they roll 2d6 dice (2 die, each 6 sides). If the total of the roll is +10, the action succeeds. If it's 7-9, it's a partial success, and if it's 6 or below, the action fails.</p>
        <p>For every relevant power tag a player has across their 4 themes, 1 "power" is added to the roll, meaning you add 1 to the die roll detemining if the action succeds. So, if a character tries to dodge an attack, the tag "cat-like reflexes," they add 1 to the roll. For every weakness tag, the player subtracks 1 from the roll.</p>
        <p>CoM also has a variety of "actions," which, while decided with the same die roll, have slightly different effects. Later Son of Oak (SoO) Games that have the same tag system simplify these to one type of action, and it's only effects that are different.</p>

        <p>CHARACTER GROWTH</p>
        <p>For every theme, there is a mystery if it's a Mythos theme, and an identity if it's a Logos theme. The mystery is something the character's mythos wants them to investigate, and the identity is something key to the character's mundane life.</p>
        <p>Every theme has an "attention" track and either a "fade" track if it's mythos, and a "crack" track if it's logos. Every time the character investigates the theme's mystery or upholds its identity, mark 1 attention. 3 attention leads to a slight upgrade, such as an additional power tag (weakness tags also give attention when they effect a role).</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if the mystery is ignored, or if the character goes against the identity, 1 fade/crack is marked. 3 fade/crack marks means the theme is lost, and is replaced by a different theme <b>of the opposite type</b>. There is also a major upgrade that happens to the new theme, as well as keeping some of the previous upgrades to the lost theme.</p>
        <p>How many Mythos/Logos themes a character has represents how much the character is effected by their mythos, how much they have let it control them, how much they have retained of their sense of self, or how much a <a style="color: #00FFFF;">The Mist</a> has power over them. In this way, <b>The game system itself ties directly to the story of the character, and changes in the character are mechanically enforced</b>.</p>
