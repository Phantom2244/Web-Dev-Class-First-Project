        <h2>TTRPGs...</h2>

        <p>Table Top Role Playing Games (TTRPGs) are games where players take on the role of characters, and describe their actions while going through a story managed by a game master (GM).</p>
        <p>In TTRPGs, when characters take actions, the players usueally role dice or preform some other action to determine if what a character attempts to do succeeds. The exact rules behind these rolls changes from game system to game system, but this is the general outline of how TTRPGs work.</p>
        <p>When it comes to TTRPGs, the goal for the players isn't usually as laid out as "use all your cards" or "play a royal flush." Usually, the way players "win" is just by completeing a story, as playing through a story tends to be the focus of these games. The players and GM aren't even oppenents, their just people plaing opposing characters to build the same story.</p>
        <p>This all brings us to a particular TTRPG, known as <a style="color: #f25cf9; background-color: black;">City of Mist (CoM)</a>, created by Son of Oak (SoO) Games.</p>
        <br>
      </article>

      <article id="mundane-article">
        <p>CoM takes place in a modern city, like New York, San Fransico, or any other city you may know of. The exact city doesn't matter, and the city your game takes place in doesn't even need to be named.</p>
        <p>People go about their daily lives here. They have mundane jobs, normal lives, and a wide range of relationships. Sure, there are definitely criminals, and sometimes something unexplanable happens, but most people know that their city is a normal one.</p>

        <p>Except for the rifts.</p>
        <p>In truth, there is a force pressing on the city, bringing out the true character of its residents, and spicing up whatever happens. The Mythoi.</p>
        <p>A Mythos is, in essance, a story. Whether it is a fictional character, a concept, a fable, or some other type of transferable idea, stories exist as present forces in this city, and when they attach themeselves to a person or thing, that person or thing becomes a rift.</p>
        <p>Rifts gain abilities unlike anything many would think possible, from teleportation, to mind control, to even turing the world around them into a dream. A rift can inflict massive changes in this city, but their powers aren't free. Rifts constantly feel their Mythos' desisre for the rift to reinact their stories, a precence always weighing on their mind. Being more connected with a Mythos leads to greater power, but it also makes it harder to resist a Mythos' influence.</p>
        <p><a style="color: black; background-color: white;">If a rift resists their Mythos to much, they stand a chance of losing it.</a></p>
        <p>And if a rift gives in to their Mythos completly, they can become an Avatar, a being of immense power capible of changing the city forever, at the cost of being comepletly unable to defy their Mythos, lest they lose their newfound power completely.</p>

        <p>Even with rifts battling in  the streets, or working their influences in the shadows, people go about their normal lives, many acting as if nothing strange is happening…</p>

        <p>…Because they can't remember. They can't consider something the like. <a style="color: #00FFFF;">The Mist</a> prevents it.</p>
        <p><a style="color: #00FFFF;">The Mist</a> is a force that covers up the precence of the mythos. A fire elemental is seen as a sudden explosion. A sound causes someone to turn away right before a Werewolf transforms. Someone recognizes something clearly supernatural at last, only to instantly forget it. <a style="color: #00FFFF;">The Mist</a> works tirelessly to achieve these effects.</p>
        <p>Not even rifts are immune to <a style="color: #00FFFF;">The Mist</a>. They may be more resistant, a resistance that grows stronger the more they give into their mythos, but <a style="color: #00FFFF;">The Mist</a> is still always trying to drag them back to sleep.</p>
